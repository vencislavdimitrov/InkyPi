## Installation
To install InkyPi, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vencislavdimitrov/InkyPi.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

After the installation is complete, the script will prompt you to reboot your Raspberry Pi. Once rebooted, the display will update to show the InkyPi splash screen.

Note:
- The installation script requires sudo privileges to install and run the service. We recommend starting with a fresh installation of Raspberry Pi OS to avoid potential conflicts with existing software or configurations.
- The installation process will automatically enable the required SPI and I2C interfaces on your Raspberry Pi.

For more details, including instructions on how to image your microSD with Raspberry Pi OS, refer to [installation.md](./docs/installation.md). You can also checkout [this YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/L5PvQj1vfC4).
